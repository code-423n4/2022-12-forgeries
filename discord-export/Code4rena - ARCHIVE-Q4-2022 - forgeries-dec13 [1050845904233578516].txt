[12/14/2022 17:16] aviggiano
hi there
I have a question about the audit scope of this contest
The README says
> 5. The NFT up for raffle and NFT that is used for the raffle are non-malicious contracts not attempting to compromise this raffle contract (within reason). Assume creators of raffles will do checks to ensure that the NFT itself is not compromised or unusual preventing the functioning of the raffle contract.
If raffle creators try to rug users by creating a raffle with a specific set of parameters, and the contract fails to provide sufficient safeguards, is it also out of scope?


[12/14/2022 20:33] iainnash
Sorry, I don't have windows. Tests seem to work on linux and osx.


[12/14/2022 20:34] iainnash
Depends on a lot of definitions. There are already some safeguards on the parameters but it's also within reason since users can read the parameters as well.

{Reactions}
👍 

[12/14/2022 20:38] aviggiano
Thanks
Another question: how will the funding of LINK tokens work for the `VRFNFTRandomDraw` contract? I don't see it in the docs


[12/14/2022 21:42] iainnash
The funding of LINK tokens happens through a subscription. See subscription ID.


[12/14/2022 21:43] iainnash
It's using the v2 of the chain.link contracts.

{Reactions}
👍 

[12/14/2022 22:13] chaduke#3730
after a winner claims the NFT, can we have another raffle with the same contract? Or at most one raffle for each VRFNFTRandomDraw?


[12/15/2022 07:25] iainnash
@chaduke The design was at most one raffle. Another contract will need to be made for another drawing.

@KmanOfficial also gives a quick method to check: take a look at leaderboard data https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com/main/_data/findings/findings.csv , this file gives all wardens' all findings, including label data. (But still need to wait for the detail of the findings). For this contest, this file is updated by this pr: https://github.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com/pull/7210/files
